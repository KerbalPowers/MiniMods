A series of small mods which make patch-scale changes to KSP but cannot be done without custom code.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Alternate Steering

Allows the TR-2L and S2 wheels to alternate between pivot(normal) and differential steering modes.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Battery Drainer

Battery Drainer automatically reduces the ec within batteries to a reduced and configurable percentage of their capacity upon launch. Like a brand new Phone!

-------------------------------------------------------
### Internal Combustion

Combustion adds a mode to fuel cells that lets them use intake air in place of oxidiser. Perfect for smaller propeller aircraft! This mod also includes the codebase for convertors which cannot be disabled, used in [KP Dynamics](https://github.com/Spartwo/KP-Dynamics) to power the simple nuclear reactors.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Radiator Tracking Toggle

Allows users to enable or disable the movement of deployable radiators with relation to the sun while preserving their core functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Torque Capper

Adds a configurable torque maximum in relation to vessel mass, by default only applies to vessels with the BD Armory fixed-wing-aircraft AI part.

-------------------------------------------------------


Many of these small plugins were written to enforce game rules for the Kerbal Powers role-play. More info can be found at:
