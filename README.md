A series of small mods which make patch-scale changes to KSP but cannot be done without custom code.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Alternate Steering

Allows the TR-2L and S2 wheels to alternate between pivot(normal) and differential steering modes.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Battery Drainer

Battery Drainer automatically reduces the ec within batteries to a reduced and configurable percentage of their capacity upon launch. Like a brand new Phone!

-------------------------------------------------------
### Radiator Tracking Toggle

Allows users to enable or disable the movement of deployable radiators with relation to the sun while preserving their core functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------
### Torque Capper

Adds a configurable torque maximum in relation to vessel mass, by default only applies to vessels with the BD Armory fixed-wing-aircraft AI part.

-------------------------------------------------------


Many of these small plugins were written to enforce game rules for the Kerbal Powers role-play. More info can be found at:
